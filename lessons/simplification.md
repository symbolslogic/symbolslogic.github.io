Simplification (Simp) is a very simple argument form that allows the extraction of a conjunct from a [conjunction]({{ site.baseurl }}/lessons/conjunction.html).

> a ^ b
> <hr>
> a

Given a conjunction, `a ^ b`, we know that both `a` and `b` are true. Therefore, we can safely conclude `a` is true.

Let us whip up an example:

"You have milk (M) and cheese (C). Thus, you have milk (M)."

> 1. M ^ C
    <hr>
> 2. M

Do not let the simplicity of this argument form dishearten you. It is commonly used as an intermediary conclusion (sub-conclusion). You might be thinking, "but is it not obvious?" Yes, it is, that is partly why formal logic is so beautiful, because we need these simple and straight-forward methods to help us clarify, dissect, and breakdown more complex truths.
