title: Argument Basics

In the abstract, an argument is a structure of reasoning that attempts to derive a truth by assuming some truth. In practice, this usually means that a number of reasons are given as to _why_ you should believe something is true. To use an analogy, it is like a factory-line, where its materials are "assumed truths" (reasons) and its product is a "new truth" (what you should believe to be true). From that description, you know there are fundamentally two parts to an argument:

1. That which is assumed to be true (reasons/the materials).
2. A truth that is derived from part 1 (the product).

We refer to Part 1 as premises. A premise is any statement that "gives" support to another statement, or aids in deriving another statement. In our analogy, we are likening a premise to raw materials that are used to make a "new truth".

We refer to Part 2 as a conclusion. A conclusion is any statement that "receives" support from another statement, or is derived from another statement or set of statements. In the analogy, a conclusion is the "product" that is derived from the "materials".

> I heard barking. So, there must be a dog.

In the example above, "I heard barking" is being used to derive "there must be a dog". That means "I heard barking" is a premise and "there must be a dog" is the conclusion. "I heard barking" is a statement that gives support to the statement that "there must be a dog". Conversely, "there must be a dog" is a statement that receives support from "I heard barking".

One way to decipher which statement is receiving support is to ask "why is it that [insert statement]?". For example, why is it that "there must be a dog"? If an argument answers that question in a way that fits "because [other statement or list of statements within the argument], then that is a conclusion within that argument. In this case, why is it that "there must be a dog" is answered by because "I heard barking".

Furthermore, arguments often use indicator words and phrases to distinguish premises from conclusions. "Therefore", "thus", and "so" can indicate a conclusion while "because" and "for the reason that" can indicate premises.

To avoid any ambiguities or confusion, we will place our arguments into a form that makes it easy to distinguish premise from conclusion, and moreover, explictly state from which statements a conclusion was derived.

> 1. I heard barking.
    <hr />
> 2. There must be a dog. (1)

Using this form, statements above the line separator are premises; statements below the line are conclusions; and finally, each conclusion has at least one line number in paranthesis to list its support.

Whew, you now know the two fundamental parts of an argument, we briefly went over how to distinguish them, and even introduced a form that makes them explicit. For now, resist the urge to get bogged down in the details. You will naturally pick up these skills and more as you analyze more arguments and become better aware of _argument structure_.
