title: Argument Soundness
---

Recall from the previous lesson that an argument can have problems from both of its fundamental parts:

1. One or more of the assumed truths (premises) might be false.
2. The newly derived truth (conclusion) may have been derived incorrectly.

In "Argument Validity", we discussed how validity is only concerned with problems that stem from part 2. That said, if an argument is valid _and_ its premises are verified as true, then it is _sound_. Restated, an argument is sound when its conclusion is derived validly and its premises are verified as true (not merely assumbed to be so).

At this point

Yet, that is by design. Validity allows us to study arguments based soley on their form (which we will cover in the next lesson). This means just by knowing the form of an argument, we can immediately conclude whether it is valid or invalid. At this point, that might not seem like much, but this mere practice can potentially save us hours of research

That is where argument soundness comes in. An argument is _sound_ when it is valid AND its premises are actually true. Its premises are not merely assumptions but have been substantiated in the real world.

These byte-lessons are not focused on argument soundness, but will instead be focused on argument validity and determining whether an argument has sufficient support or not. Assessing premises for truth may require a substantial amount of research. Furthermore, if an argument is invalid, it is also unsound, so by focusing on argument validity, we are doing the most for our reasoning skills in the least amount of time. 

In the next lesson, we will talk about symbolizing statements and how doing so can help us in assessing argument validity and form.
