title: Argument Soundness
---

Recall from the previous lesson that an argument can have problems from both of its fundamental parts:

1. One or more of the assumed truths (premises) might be false.
2. The newly derived truth (conclusion) may have been derived incorrectly.

In assessing argument validity, we discussed how validity is only concerned with problems that stem from part 2. Of course, this means an entire set of potential problems is overlooked. Yet, that is not an error, validity is simply not concerned with those problems.

That is where argument soundness comes in. An argument is _sound_ when it is valid AND its premises are actually true. Its premises are not merely assumptions but have been substantiated in the real world as facts.

These byte-lessons are not focused on argument soundness, but will instead be focused on argument validity and determining whether an argument has sufficient support or not. Assessing premises for truth may require a substantial amount of research. Furthermore, if an argument is invalid, it is also unsound, so by focusing on argument validity, we are doing the most for our reasoning skills in the least amount of time. 

In the next lesson, we will talk about symbolizing statements and how doing so can help us in assessing argument validity and form.
