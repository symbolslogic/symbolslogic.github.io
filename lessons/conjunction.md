title: Conjunction
---

The conjunction is a logical connective that establishes an "and" relationship between two statements. It is commonly symbolized using the "∧" symbol.

> a ∧ b

The statements on both sides of the conjunction symbol are called "conjuncts".

In order for a conjunction to be true, __both__ conjuncts must be true. Thus, if either conjunct is found to be false, the entire conjunction is false.

Let us solidify our understanding using a quick example: "The dog barks (B) and the cat runs away (R)".

> B ∧ R

Given this conjunction, can we say that B is true? Can we say that R is true? Can we say that both B and R are true?

Yes, all three scenarios must be true; or the conjunction is false.
