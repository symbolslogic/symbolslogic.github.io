title: Everything is Bool
---

A statement is either true or false--this is referred to as its "boolean value".

In symbolic logic, we typically express a statement with a single uppercased letter, like A, B, or C. To express that a statement is true, we leave it as it is:

Statement A is true:

>1. A

However, to denote that a statement is false, we show that it has been negated:

Statement A is false: 

>1. ~A

That said, if we know that A is false, then ~A is true. A is false, ~A denotes that A is false, thus ~A is true.
