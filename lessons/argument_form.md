title: Argument Form
---

We can further reduce ambiguity and faciliate the study of logic by symbolizing the statements of an argument and generalizing its overall form.

> 1. I heard barking.
    <hr>
> 2. There must be a dog. (1)

Let "B" represent the statement "I heard barking" and let "D" represent the statement "there must be a dog."

> 1. B
    <hr>
> 2. D (1)

If we want to add the missing assumption to make the argument valid, we can let "B → D" symbolze "If you hear barking, then there must be a dog". Note: this statement includes a logical connective known as the implication, if you are unfamiliar with it, do not worry; we will cover it in a later lesson--the point of this lesson is solely on symbolizing statements and generalizing them into forms.

> 1. B → D
> 2. B
    <hr>
> 3. D (1, 2)

Now that we have symbolized our statements, it is easier to recognize the form of the argument. To generalize a form, we use variables, which can be thought of as placeholders for statements and are represented with lowercase letters.

> a → b <br>
> a 
><hr>
> b

Side note: forms do not contain line numbers. This is to convey that premise order does not matter. For example, if line numbers 1 and 2 were switched in the previous argument, so that "B" was line number 1 and "B → D" was line number 2, it would still follow the above form.

With its form identified, we can easily parallel an argument, which means to generate another argument that follows a given form. Let us use: "If it is raining (R), you need an umbrella (U). It is raining (R). So, you need an umbrella (U)".

> 1. R → U
> 2. R
    <hr>
> 3. U

We can immediately recognize that "R" is in the place of "a" and "U" is in the place of "b", so this argument follows the previously mentioned form. Now what if we had something like "If it is raining, you need an umbrella. You need an umbrella. So, it is raining."?

> 1. R → U
> 2. U
    <hr>
> 3. R

This is NOT the same form. Instead, it follows the form:

> 1. a → b
> 2. b
    <hr>
> 3. a

This slight difference is the difference between _modus ponens_ and _the fallacy of the converse_. The first being one of the most common valid argument forms and the second being one of the most common invalid forms--or fallacies--in formal logic. There is much more to be said about the two aforementioned argument forms and their differences. However, before we can dive into studying argument forms, we still need to know the difference between an affirmed or negated statement.
