Hypothetical Syllogism (HS) is a valid argument form that essentially connects the middle term that is common in two [implications]({{ site.baseurl }}/lessons/implication.html).

> a → b <br>
> b → c
><hr>
> a → b

Note: The statement encapsulated by the variable `b` is common to both implications and is used as the middle term in bridging the conclusion `a → c`.

It may be helpful to reuse the geographical analogy from [Modus Ponens (MP)]({{ site.baseurl }}/lessons/modus_ponens.html) to get a sense about HS:

If you are in Los Angeles (L), then you are in California (C). If you are in California (C), then you are in the United States (U). You are in Los Angeles, therefore, you are in the United States (U).

> 1. L → C
> 2. C → U
    <hr>
> 3. L → U <span class="deduction-support">HS 1, 2</span>
