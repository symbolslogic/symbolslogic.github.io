Conjunction (Conj) is a very simple argument form that allows two statements to be combined into a single [conjunction (connective)]({{ site.baseurl }}/lessons/conjunction.html). 

> a
> b
> <hr>
> a ^ b

Example:

"You have milk (M). You have cheese (C). Therefore, you have milk (M) and cheese (C)."

> 1. M
> 2. C
    <hr>
> 3. M ^ C

Again, like [Simp]({{ site.baseurl }}/lessons/simplification.html), this is a very simple argument form that is commonly used as an intermediary conclusion.

Just imagine, you have an [implication]({{ site.baseurl }}/lessons/implication.html) that has a (conjunction)({{ site.baseurl }}/lessons/conjunction.html) as its antecedent, but there are no given statements that are conjunctions, Conj might be the perfect tool for the job.
