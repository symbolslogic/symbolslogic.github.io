<h2 id="paymentpolicy">Payment Policy</h2>
<h3 id="paidsubscriptions">Paid Subscriptions</h3>
<p>With paid subscriptions, users gain access to more features of the app or can access features that would otherwise be locked to users without a paid subscription.</p>
<p>Paid subscriptions are made available to users in exchange for a fee.</p>
<p>The fee is paid by the user using either the Apple App Store (for users on iOS) or the Google Play Store (for users on Android).</p>
<p>Each paid subscription comes with a duration in time for which the additional access is granted to the user. For example, a monthly subscription grants the user additional access and more features for the duration of a month.</p>
<p>Unless otherwise stated by the store that offers the purchase, paid subscriptions are "auto-renewed", which means that at the end of their duration, the subscription is automatically renewed and the agreed upon fee is automatically withdrawn from the user or charged to the user by the Apple App Store or Google Play Store. Unless otherwise stated by the offering store, paid subscriptions "auto-renew" until they are canceled or terminated by the user. For information on how to cancel a paid subscription, please see the "Termination or Cancellation of Paid Subscriptions" section.</p>
<p><strong>All purchases of paid subscriptions are final and non-refundable</strong>. We encourage users to use as many of the free features as is available to them so that they may make an informed decision about whether or not to purchase a paid subscription.</p>
<h3 id="terminationorcancellationofpaidsubscriptions">Termination or Cancellation of Paid Subscriptions</h3>
<p>All purchases, including paid subscriptions, purchased through the Apple Apple Store or Google Play Store can be managed through the account that you have with the respective store. You can manage your paid subscriptions and cancel or terminate any of them.</p>
<p>If you cancel or terminate any paid subscription, it will remain active until the end of your subscription period (duration), and will simply not be renewed in the next billing cycle.</p>
<p><strong>Please understand that you must cancel or terminate a paid subscription when you no longer wish to use or pay for the service. It is not sufficient to uninstall the app or delete your account with us</strong>. This is because the paid subscription can only be purchased through an offering store (the Apple App Store or the Google Play Store), and so, must be canceled through the respective store(s) from which you purchased the paid subscription from.</p>
<p>To cancel or terminate your subscription through the Apple App Store, please visit the following page:</p>
<p>(https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202039)</p>
<p>To cancel or terminate your subscription through the Google Play Store, please visit the following page:</p>
<p>(https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/7018481?hl=en&amp;co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid)</p>
<p>Disclaimer: Before purchasing a paid subscription, it is the responsibility of the user to to be familiar with the policies and processes of the respective store from where they wish to make the purchase of a paid subscription. We are not a part of the Apple App Store or the Google Play Store, so after a user has made a purchase using either store, all matters pertaining to said purchase are between the user and the respective store or stores. So, if a user wishes to cancel or terminate a paid subscription or paid subscriptions, they must do so through their account with the respective store or stores from which they made the purchase or purchases.</p>
<p>Since we are not a part of the Apple App Store or the Google Play Store, we have no control over their policies, and since their policies are subject to change in accordance with their wishes, we cannot list them in this section. Furthermore, the methods that these stores use for canceling or terminating paid subscriptions may themselves change. For that reason, we have provided the user with the links on how to cancel a paid subscription from either store as they are in the present. If, for whatever reason in the future, any link has been moved or is otherwise unavailable and we do not update the broken link, it is the responsibility of the user nonetheless to find these resources and to become familiar with them.</p>
<h3 id="feechanges">Fee Changes</h3>
<p>We reserve the right to change our fees and prices for paid subscriptions or any other product or service at any time.</p>
<p>We will give you a reasonable notice about any price change through our App, Website, or by notifying you via email.</p>
<p>If you find the new price disagreeable, you may choose to cancel your paid subscription before the price change goes into effect.</p>
<h2 id="privacypolicy">Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>At Symbols, we respect the privacy of our users. Please see our Privacy Policy. By using our service, you consent to our collection and use of personal data as outlined therein.</p>
<h2 id="terminationpolicy">Termination Policy</h2>
<p>We reserve the right to delete any user account (and any of its corresponding data) and will do so at our sole discretion, for any reason, including but not limited to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Suspicion of illegal activity or use of the app or website in an unintended or malicious way;</li>
<li>If the user posts, shares, or transmits abusive or insensitive content to or through our app or website;</li>
<li>If we suspect the security of a user account has been compromised and is being used by multiple, unauthorized persons.</li>
</ol>
<p>If a user wishes to terminate their account with us, they may do so by deleting their account. This can be done through the app using the "Delete My Account" button in the Settings page.</p>
<p>As mentioned in the "Payment Policy" section of these terms, please remember that the deletion or termination of your account with us, whether it is initiated by you or done by us, is insufficient in canceling any paid subscriptions that you may have with us in either the Apple App Store or the Google Play Store. Since paid subscriptions are entered into by the user and one or both of the respective store(s), they must be canceled by the user through their account with the relevant store(s).</p>
<p>This should not be a problem since both stores make it very easy for the user to manage and cancel any paid subscription.</p>
<h2 id="miscellaneous">Miscellaneous</h2>
<p>Governing Law: Any claim relating to our service shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>
<p>No Implied Waiver: Failure to insist upon or enforce strict performance of any provision of these terms shall not be construed as a waiver of any provision or right.</p>
<p>Severability: The provisions of these terms are severable. In the event that any court of competent jurisdiction determines that any provision is invalid or unenforceable, such validity and unenforceability shall not in any way affect the validity or unenforceability of the remaining provisions.</p>
<p>Refunds: All sales are final and non-refundable. We encourage use of any trials or free features before any purchase.</p>  </body>
